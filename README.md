## Why this repository?

The official PhotoCraft project provides a WebAssembly-based version that can be hosted as a static website. This repository packages the web application into a Docker image to simplify self-hosting.

The goals are to:

- Build the PhotoCraft Web application from the upstream source code.
- Publish a ready-to-run Docker image to GHCR.
- Automatically rebuild the image every week to incorporate upstream changes.
- Provide a convenient deployment option for Unraid Community Applications.
- Offer a simple Docker Compose configuration for users who prefer managing containers with Compose.
- Keep the packaging and deployment configuration separate from the upstream PhotoCraft project.

This is a packaging and distribution project, not a fork intended to develop a separate image editor.

## How it works

PhotoCraft Web runs directly in the user's browser using WebAssembly. The Docker container serves the static web application through NGINX; it does not provide a remote Linux desktop.

- **Browser-based interface:** access the editor through a web browser.
- **Local file selection:** opening a file uses the browser's file picker.
- **Browser downloads:** saving and exporting documents uses the browser's download mechanism.
- **No remote desktop:** no VNC, remote desktop session or Linux graphical environment is required.
- **Self-hosted:** run the application on your own server and access it over your local network or through a properly configured reverse proxy.

File selection, editing and export are handled by the browser application. The container serves the application files rather than acting as a document-storage service.

## Docker image

The image is published to GitHub Container Registry:

```text
ghcr.io/mikapst/photocraft-web:latest
```

### Option 1 — Docker Compose (recommended)

A `docker-compose.yml` file is provided at the root of this repository. It is the simplest way to start and maintain PhotoCraft Web with Docker Compose.

```yaml
services:
  photocraft-web:
    image: ghcr.io/mikapst/photocraft-web:latest
    container_name: photocraft-web
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

From the repository root, start the application with:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Open the application in your browser:

```text
http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8080
```

Replace `YOUR_SERVER_IP` with the IP address or hostname of your server. If Docker is running on your own computer, you can use `http://localhost:8080`.

#### Useful Compose commands

```bash
# View container logs
docker compose logs -f

# Pull the latest image and recreate the container
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d

# Stop and remove the container
docker compose down
```

No `.env` file or persistent volume is required for this basic setup. The host port is configured in `docker-compose.yml`; by default, port `8080` on the host is mapped to port `8080` in the container. To use a different host port, change the left-hand side of the mapping. For example, `8081:8080` exposes the application on host port `8081`.

### Option 2 — Run directly with Docker

If you prefer not to use Docker Compose, you can run the container directly:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/mikapst/photocraft-web:latest

docker run -d \
  --name photocraft-web \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  ghcr.io/mikapst/photocraft-web:latest
```

Open the application at:

```text
http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8080
```

Optional CPU and memory limits can be added to the `docker run` command if needed, for example `--cpus=2 --memory=2g`. These limits are not included in the default Compose file.

### Network access and reverse proxies

The container listens for HTTP traffic on port `8080`. For external access, use a reverse proxy such as Traefik to terminate HTTPS and forward requests to the container over HTTP.

Do not expose an unencrypted HTTP port directly to the public Internet. Restrict access to your intended network or protect external access with HTTPS and appropriate access controls.

## Automated builds

GitHub Actions builds and publishes the image automatically.

| Trigger | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Weekly schedule | Rebuilds from the upstream `main` branch |
| Manual workflow dispatch | Allows a build to be triggered manually |
| Workflow changes on `main` | Triggers a build when the workflow file changes |

Each successful build publishes:

- `latest` — the most recently published image.
- `sha-<commit>` — a build-specific tag for identifying an image.

The build targets `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`. Actual compatibility depends on the upstream build and the target platform.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A weekly build does not guarantee that upstream changes are compatible or stable. PhotoCraft is under active development and is currently described by its maintainers as an early-alpha project. Test new images before relying on them for important work.

The `latest` tag is mutable and may point to a newer image after a successful build.

## Unraid Community Applications

This image is intended to be distributed through the maintainer's existing Unraid Community Applications repository.

The Unraid template references the published GHCR image and provides configuration for the web port and resource limits.

- **Unraid Community Applications repository:** [MikaPST/unraid-community-apps](https://github.com/MikaPST/unraid-community-apps)
- **PhotoCraft Web template:** [photocraft-web.xml](https://github.com/MikaPST/unraid-community-apps/blob/main/templates/photocraft-web.xml)

This repository contains the image build, publication workflow and Docker Compose configuration. The Unraid Community Applications template is maintained separately.

## Upstream project

PhotoCraft is an open-source image editor developed by the ArtCraft Team and its contributors.

- **Source code:** [storytold/photocraft](https://github.com/storytold/photocraft)
- **Official website:** [getartcraft.com/apps/photocraft](https://getartcraft.com/apps/photocraft)
- **Official web hosting guide:** [Docker web hosting](https://github.com/storytold/photocraft/blob/main/packaging/web/README.md)
- **Official releases:** [PhotoCraft releases](https://github.com/storytold/photocraft/releases)

This repository builds the Docker image using the upstream project's Dockerfile and packaging files. The Docker packaging recipe is community-maintained upstream and may not always match the latest official web release.
